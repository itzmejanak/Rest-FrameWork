## Throttling

Throttling in Django REST Framework is a way to control the rate of requests a user can make to your API. It helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage by limiting how many times a user can access the API within a given timeframe. Throttling can be set globally or for specific views. Common types include AnonRateThrottle for anonymous users and UserRateThrottle for authenticated users. Each type has a rate limit defined, such as "1000/day" or "5/minute". When a user exceeds the limit, they receive a "429 Too Many Requests" response. To implement throttling, you configure it in the `settings.py` file and specify the rates you want to enforce. This helps maintain performance and security by reducing server load and deterring excessive access attempts.

### Throttling in Django REST Framework

Throttling controls the rate of requests a client can make to your API. It prevents abuse and ensures fair usage by setting limits on how frequently requests can be made.

#### How Throttling Works

1. **Global Settings:** Define default throttle classes and rates in `settings.py`:

   ```python
   REST_FRAMEWORK = {
       'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
           'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
           'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
       ],
       'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
           'anon': '100/day',
           'user': '1000/day'
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Types of Throttles:**
   - **AnonRateThrottle:** Limits requests from anonymous users.
   - **UserRateThrottle:** Limits requests from authenticated users.

3. **Custom Throttling:**
   - Create a custom throttle class by subclassing `BaseThrottle` and implementing the `allow_request` and `wait` methods.

4. **View-Level Throttling:**
   - Apply throttling to specific views:

   ```python
   from rest_framework.views import APIView
   from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle

   class CustomThrottleView(APIView):
       throttle_classes = [UserRateThrottle]

       def get(self, request):
           return Response({"message": "Hello, world!"})
   ```

5. **Handling Throttle Exceedance:**
   - When a client exceeds the throttle limit, a "429 Too Many Requests" response is returned.

6. **Monitoring Throttling:**
   - Use logging to monitor throttle usage and adjust rates as needed.

### Summary

Throttling ensures API stability by regulating request rates, protecting against overuse, and maintaining performance. It can be applied globally or per-view and customized to fit specific needs.
