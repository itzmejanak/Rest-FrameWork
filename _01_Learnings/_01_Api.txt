## API (Application Programming Interface)

API is the intermediary that allows two or more applications to talk to each other.

### API Types in Terms of Release Policies
- **Private**: It can be used within the organization.
- **Partner**: It can be used within the business organization.
- **Public**: It can be used by any third-party developers.

> Note: We use API for making communication from any platform (Android, Mac, Linux) to the same backend.

### How Can We Use API?
To use an API, we need a token or API key of that API.

## Web API
- The API which is an interface for the web is called a web API.
- It may consist of one or more endpoints to define request and response.

### How Web API Works
- Let's say we have an Android device, web API, web application, and database.
  - Client makes an HTTP request to the API.
  - API will communicate with the web application/database (if needed).
  - Web application/database provides required data to the API.
  - API returns data to the client.

### How to Use Web API
- First, we will sign up to the API. After signing in, we will get an API key. Whenever we have to communicate, we will send a request to the API with the API key to authenticate us. If authentication is successful, we will get services/data from the database.
