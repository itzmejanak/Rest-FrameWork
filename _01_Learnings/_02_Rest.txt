## REST

To understand REST API, we need to know about API and Web API that we discussed before.

### REST
- REST is the architectural guideline to develop Web APIs.

### REST API
The API which is developed by following the guidelines made in the REST web guideline is known as REST API. 

> Note: REST API and RESTful API are the same. Don't get confused about them.

### How REST Web API Works
Let's say we have an Android application, Web API, web application, and database.

Whenever the client makes an HTTP request to the API:
1. The API communicates with the web application/database.
2. The web application/database provides the required data to the Web API.
3. The Web API then provides the response to the client (Android application).

> Note: The request is made by HTTP, and the data we receive may be in JSON or XML format.

### CRUD Operations in REST API
When talking about REST API, we are generally talking about CRUD operations.

| Operation | HTTP Methods | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Create    | POST          | Creating/Posting/Inserting Data |
| Read      | GET           | Reading/Getting/Retrieving Data |
| Update    | PUT/PATCH     | Updating Data (Complete update - PUT, Partial update - PATCH) |
| Delete    | DELETE        | Deleting Data |

### Understanding URL
```
http://greekyshows.com/api/students
```
- **Base URL**: `http://greekyshows.com`
- **API**: Naming convention to indicate that inside API we have endpoints
- **Students**: Resource of API/endpoints

### Understanding Request and Response

#### Getting All Data
- **Request**: `GET /api/students`
- **Response**: `[{id:1, name: Janak}, {id:2, name: Ram}]`

#### Getting Specific Data
- **Request**: `GET /api/students/1`
- **Response**: `[{id:1, name: Janak}]`

#### Inserting Data
- **Request**: `POST /api/students {id:2, name: Ram}`
- **Response**: `[{id:2, name: Ram}]`

#### Updating Data
- **Request**: `PUT or PATCH /api/students/1 {name: Sita}`
- **Response**: `[{id:1, name: Sita}]`

#### Deleting Data
- **Request**: `DELETE /api/students/1`
- **Response**: `[{id:1, name: Sita}]`
